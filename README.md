# SPD 1.1 Introduction to Software Product Development

## Course Description

How can I take my values, ideas, and experiences and make them into great products? Which features should I prioritize? In this beginner project-based course, you’ll learn how to create products that people love. We’ll follow industry best practice of understand user needs (user interviews), build iterative prototypes (wireframes, user journeys, entity relationship diagrams, scoping), and do the work to validate your idea (user testing). This course teaches you how to get the right idea, that you will then ultimately build during the “week long intensive” – our word form of a hackathon – following completion of SPD 1. The lessons learned will apply to your work in other classes, too.

This course also teaches the “success skills” necessary to become a well-rounded product developer, including using professional communication best practices, building healthy habits, and getting feedback from industry contacts and peers.

## Evaluation

To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:
- Complete all sections of the Software Product Development [Blog Post Assignment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qivWC5VE4bo7A0YYgJ6dgnW1dV61QGIeSXBwfc4kkF0/edit#heading=h.pxjuoqz282qp) (see [Writing/Blog Post Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T1oqHFoRo0kl7mPUTFupmsoEkLYltKsVgtqyGKDaCgY/edit))
- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy
- Make up all classwork from all absences

## Attendance

Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions including classes, huddles, coaching and school meetings, and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP is cause for not being allowed to continue at Make School.

## Hybrid Sections

There will be weekly in person activities on Wednesdays at 12pm about:

1. Agile Standups I
1. Agile Standups II
2. Habit Formation 
1. Agile Standups III
