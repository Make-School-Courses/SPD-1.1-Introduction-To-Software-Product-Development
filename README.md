# SPD 1.1 Introduction to Software Product Development

## Course Description

What makes for a great product idea? Which features should I prioritize? In this beginner project-based course, you’ll learn how to create products that people love. We’ll follow industry best practice of understand user needs (user interviews), build iterative prototypes (wireframes, user journeys, entity relationship diagrams, scoping), and do the work to validate your idea (user testing). This course teaches you how to get the right idea, that you will then ultimately build during the “week long intensive” – our word form of a hackathon – following completion of SPD 1. The lessons learned will apply to your work in other classes, too.

This course also teaches the “success skills” necessary to become a well-rounded product developer, including using professional communication best practices, building healthy habits, and getting feedback from industry contacts and peers.

## 7. Procrastination & Work Life Balance ([Class Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13Tfrk_6at1Vj1N0fmwPbqs-FftU7QaLYcW3eVPJXYb8/edit))
   - **In Class Activities**   
      - *Habit Formation Challenge* - How can you beat procrastination? Students are required to complete the Habit Planner Worksheet to reflect on current habits and design new work habits using Dr. BJ Fogg’s [tiny habits method](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ED5byHHeYsJhF15cLZzrC7da1HbmdDoBCS1maCbBQE/edit). Students will work with their coach to reflect on habit adoption. Students must successfully adopt or change one habit - the final exam will ask you about your habit and how you adopted it. These habits will be the foundation of your productivity for years to come.
   - **After Class** - 1) plan to execute your new work habit over the following weeks 2) consult your coach on the content of your habit planner worksheet your habit of choice; [Class Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13Tfrk_6at1Vj1N0fmwPbqs-FftU7QaLYcW3eVPJXYb8/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102349547791146369642) and [Habit Formation Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1STLc8MLmb6ohxQaaAgZDnI8AOBR8TY6PBT5ZLPn6aqA/edit)

## 8. Pick Product Idea: Scope and Design ([Class Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UKVsUOCxQPNT3P42cvsTYxhNl7lpsDHjJew_a5K1JaM/edit#slide=id.p))
   - **In Class Activities**  
      - *Pick your Product Idea* - The time has come! We've collected research from our PEST and Competitive Analysis, from user interviews and feedback from industry contacts.  You'll use all this data about the problem space to pick a product idea. How is your idea different from the competition? What needs are they not serving. The remainder of SPD 1.1 focuses on prototyping techniques, namely writing User Narratives, making Wire Frames and User Stories.
      - *User Journey* -  User Journeys involve "getting in the user's head" to draft a set of "actions" the user will take upon landing on your app or web page. Where will their eye look first? Where will they click next? Writing out the narrative ensures your site is intutive to the users' needs. Once you have the journey done, you can then move on to creating a draft of what your site will look like ... also known as a Wireframe. We'll make this wireframe in the next class.
   - **After Class** - 1) Finish your User Persona and User Narrative 2) add both the User Personal and User Narrative to your blog post draft; [Class Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UKVsUOCxQPNT3P42cvsTYxhNl7lpsDHjJew_a5K1JaM/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102349547791146369642)

## 9. Networking Events & Professionalism ([Class Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HgatbVpG_d0QqUACg59i3qhMUSK0o5IckLR3UH_hOhs/edit#slide=id.p))
   - **In Class Activities**
      - *Networking Simulation* - Networking events are incredible opportunities to get advice and feedback from professional engineers. In class, we'll simulate the dynamics of a professional networking event - entering and leaving conversations, exchanging business cards, explaining Make School, sparking conversation. In no time you'll have a solid strategy to make use of San Francisco's many meetups and events. Who knows, you may meet your future employer. Content of this exercise builds into the career prep curriculum.
      - *Product Landing Page* - Create a landing page for your product idea that you can use to ask people to sign up for your app and get feedback on it.
   - **After Class** - sign up for one of the listed networking events

## 10. Wireframes ([Class Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ALBDn3bIycimyvnB6fEOAMadDOCA4wmoOO9Z-lpBRsM/edit#slide=id.p))
   - **In Class Activities**  
      - *Make a Wireframe* - a Wireframe is a skeletal blueprint of your app. Built off the User Narrative, Wireframes are often drawn on paper as a quick prototype of your app. "Wireframes depicts the page layout or arrangement of the website’s content, including navigational systems, interface elements, and how they work together. The wireframe usually lacks typographic style, color, or graphics, since the main focus lies in functionality, behavior, and priority of content. Wireframes can be pencil drawings or sketches on a whiteboard, or they can be produced by means of a broad array of free or commercial software applications". Wireframes are ment to be rough sketches that are iterated upon.
   - **After Class** - 1) Finish your draft of your *Blog Post* and your Wireframe 2) add  the Wireframe to your blog post draft 3) user test your wireframes, and iterate!; [Class Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ALBDn3bIycimyvnB6fEOAMadDOCA4wmoOO9Z-lpBRsM/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102349547791146369642)

## 11. Blog Post Peer Editing
   - **In Class Activities**
      - *Peer Editing* - We'll peer edit each other's blog posts using the [Blog Post and Writing Rubric](www.make.sc/blog-post-rubric).
      - *SPD 1.1 Course Review for Assessment* - Instructors will give a rapid run-through of all class slides and content to help students prepare for the SPD 1.1 assessment occuring in class on Wed Oct 10th.
   - **After Class** - 1) finish your blog post final draft 2) share your blog post with your coach 3) study for the SPD 1.1 assessment occuring on Wed Oct 10th.


## 12. Agile Methodology & Backlog of User Stories ([Class Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b72IU1gYddSjqyzdByiUJYKCd2HQYYQK/view?usp=sharing))
   - **In Class Activities**
      - *Paper Plane activity* - this activity simulates Agile Development: the iterative process by which software developers make products and prioritize features. The activity will help frame the work ahead.
      - *Create a backlog of User Stories* - User Journeys are the set of actions a user will take once they land on your site. User Stories are one particular action within that journey set. Before building their app, developers list out all the user stories in order to prioritize which should be built first. Once complete, you'll be ready to build this app or another app idea during the week long intensive.
   - **After Class** - 1) Finish your blog post and update it's status in the SPD Course Tracker; [Class Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b72IU1gYddSjqyzdByiUJYKCd2HQYYQK/view?usp=sharing)

## 13. Assessment: Test & submit 1,500 word blogpost
   - **In Class Activities**
     - *Summative Assessment* - you'll take an assessment that cover the content from SPD 1.1. I recommend you review class slides and understand the major ideas taught in each activity. Don't sweat it too much. Those who miss this in-class assessment have the option to retake it the the Wednesday during the weeklong intensity.
     - *Peer review and publish blog posts* - class will close with us peer editing each other's blog posts and hitting PUBLISH! We'll then celebrate with popcorn or whatever treat Dan brings in ;)
   - **After Class** - Relax. Pat yourself on the back for your hard work! Get ready to build and ship your product idea (or a new product idea) during next week's product intensive.

## Attendance
Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions: classes, huddles, etc. and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
  - No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.  
  - No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan). Failure to improve after the PIP will result in not being invited back next term.

* Week 1: Group Formation - Get to know your fellow classmates and establish a foundation of community
    * Instructor facilitated discussion of principles of professional development and application of those principles to this cohort
* Week 2: Goal & Priority Setting - Discuss personal goals and priorities for term 1 and the entirety of Make School
    * Instructor facilitated discussion of principles of habit formation as it relates to setting personal goals and priorities
* Week 3: Appreciating Differences - Appreciating and understanding perspectives different than your own

## Coaching Schedule - one-to-one meeting between instructor and student, once per weeks
This is a general set of guidelines that will ebb and flow depending on the progress of the students.
- Review professional development activities and skills:
    - Review calendaring and how you structure your days and time
    - Audit your productivity system (time blocking, prevent distractions, single source of truth, prioritization, resourcefulness)
    - Audit your professional and personal habits that support your success
    - Audit efforts to seek out feedback from mentors and peers
- Do a code review
- Review theories, principles, and topics related to SPD course material
- In the context of professional development, discuss interests, motivations, and goals
