## In Class Activities
- *Pick your Product Idea* - The time has come! We've collected research from our PEST and Competitive Analysis, from user interviews and feedback from industry contacts.  You'll use all this data about the problem space to pick a product idea. How is your idea different from the competition? What needs are they not serving. The remainder of SPD 1.1 focuses on prototyping techniques, namely writing User Narratives, making Wire Frames and User Stories.
- *User Journey* -  User Journeys involve "getting in the user's head" to draft a set of "actions" the user will take upon landing on your app or web page. Where will their eye look first? Where will they click next? Writing out the narrative ensures your site is intuitive to the users' needs. Once you have the journey done, you can then move on to creating a draft of what your site will look like ... also known as a Wireframe. We'll make this wireframe in the next class.
