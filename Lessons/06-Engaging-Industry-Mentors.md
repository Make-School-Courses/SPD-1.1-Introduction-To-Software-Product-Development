## In Class Activities

   - *ICon (Industry Contact) Challenge* - Students must connect and meet with a professional engineer to learn about their work, product development process, and to get feedback on their code. They can do so through Make School’s [list of volunteer mentors](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PUffTZwaYVe3EWcCqF_2czeDV0KsEEjJzt-SIyziZVY/edit#gid=0). In class we'll discuss professional communication strategy and each draft our own reach-out email. This content builds off of the Professional Risk Challenge and Email Simulation, and will build into the Cold Emails content in later terms. Students must successfully connect with someone in industry - the final exam will ask you about your contact and what you learned.
