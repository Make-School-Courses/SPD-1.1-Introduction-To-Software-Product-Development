- *Make a Wireframe* - a Wireframe is a skeletal blueprint of your app. Built off the User Narrative, Wireframes are often drawn on paper as a quick prototype of your app. "Wireframes depicts the page layout or arrangement of the websiteâ€™s content, including navigational systems, interface elements, and how they work together. The wireframe usually lacks typographic style, color, or graphics, since the main focus lies in functionality, behavior, and priority of content. Wireframes can be pencil drawings or sketches on a whiteboard, or they can be produced by means of a broad array of free or commercial software applications". Wireframes are meant to be rough sketches that are iterated upon.
